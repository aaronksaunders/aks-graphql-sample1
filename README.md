GraphQL Sample Using json-server as data store
=========================



Your Project
------------

We have two objects, User and Company, we show the relationship between the two. We also show how to use relay connections to page through the results of the queries

The json-server is running also on a seperate instance of glitch since you cannot utilize multiple ports on one instance in glitch. See information here [https://glitch.com/edit/#!/lets-react-starter-json-server1?path=README.md:1:0](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/lets-react-starter-json-server1?path=README.md:1:0)
